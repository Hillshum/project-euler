# This is for projecteuler.net Problem 15
#
# Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and only being able to move to
# the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
#
# How many such routes exist for a 20x20 grid?
#
# Note that while the problem described the journey as upper-left to
# bottom-right, this code makes the most sense if the grid is imagined on the
# Cartesian plane with the desination as the center (0,0) and the start as a
# point to the upper-right.
